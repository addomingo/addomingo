<h3 align="left">What people should know about me:</h3>
<p align="left">
  I like designing stuff, which is what attracted me to computer science. I once visited a website that was really visually appealing to me, and at that moment I thought, "Hey, if I take up computer science, I can do that too!" Which is why I'm here taking this course at the present.

<h3 align="left">Personal Projects:</h3>
<p align="left">
  Currently, I do not have any personal projects. However, I do have a school project that I am really proud of, a mobile app my groupmates and I created for the completion of the course CMSC 23. I was in charge of designing the UI/UX of the whole app. A link to its prototype can be found here:
